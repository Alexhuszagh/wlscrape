#Malware hosted by Wikileaks

The following table contains the confirmed malware residing on the Wikileaks site. The list is by no means exhaustive; I am just starting with the analysis. But what is listed below is definitely malware; no doubts about it.

The first column contains a link to the e-mail on the Wikileaks site that contains the malicious attachment. The e-mail itself is safe to view (although the text is usually spam/scam/phish/whatever).

The second column contains the URL on the Wikileaks site where the malicious attachment to this e-mail message resides. Since this is a direct link (i.e., clicking it would result in the malware being directly downloaded to your PC), I have obfuscated the link by replacing "https" with "hxxxx" and putting square brackets around the dot in ".org", in order to make the link non-clickable. If you desire to download the malware and check for yourself that it is, indeed, malware, you can trivially deobfuscate the link - just, please, do be careful.

The third column contains links leading to a VirusTotal page, showing how the different scanners are reporting the malware. Those are safe to click.

Qudos to Hasherazade for making her tool [VTScan](https://github.com/hasherezade/mal_sort/tree/master/vtscan) for batch querying VirusTotal publicly available.
